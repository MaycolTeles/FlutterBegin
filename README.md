# FlutterBegin
[DART] A simple guide to your first app


Hi Everyone!

I'm here to help all of you in your journey on how to learn Flutter!

Here, I have some codebase from the tutorial "Write Your First App, part 1".
The code is splitted into four steps, so you can see what I've done in each step, since I've left the comments there!

I hope these codes help you and, if you have any questions, you can contact me on my e-mail!

I suggest you to follow the steps from the tutorial that I mentioned and use the code only for some visualize purpose.

The Flutter tutorial (where I get the steps to write my code) link: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/#0

Feel free to collaborate with this project! Thanks!
